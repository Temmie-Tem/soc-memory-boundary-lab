# Experiment Matrix

| ID | Hypothesis / question | Observable prediction | Controls | State/result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 001 | Live target exposes stable topology and reserved ranges read-only. | A90P1 `cat/ls` returns framed, hashable data and binary DT cells. | Fixed allowlist, no retry, target-pinned bridge, host parser tests. | `PROVED`, one live capture; repeat count 1. |
| 002 | Cold boots retain identical fixed carveouts. | DT `reg` values and structural `/proc/iomem` holes match across cold boot A/B. | Same kernel/runtime, hashes, compare dynamic counters separately. | `UNKNOWN`, not yet run. |
| 003 | Stock-like and research boots advertise the same protected ranges. | Fixed ranges equal; differences are attributable to overlays/runtime. | Bind exact boot artifact; do not equate version string with image hash. | `UNKNOWN`. |
| 004 | Source-backed LLCC/BWMON registers are readable from EL1. | Known ID/status/counter fields return plausible values without abort. | Read only exact documented widths; known-negative unmapped read in emulator/host only, never blind device scan. | `UNKNOWN`; adapter not yet executed. |
| 005 | Final address mapping is programmed outside Linux. | XBL/AOP/DDR firmware contains topology-dependent writes absent from kernel. | Exact firmware hash and call-graph provenance; distinguish training/perf from map programming. | `SUPPORTED` by Linux absence, not proved; firmware missing. |
| 006 | Normal-RAM bank/channel relationships fit a stable GF(2) model. | Timing clusters produce a cross-validated XOR matrix. | Fresh pages, pagemap/PA proof, randomized pairs, cache flush, frequency pinning, hold-out pairs. | `UNKNOWN`. |
| 007 | A controlled transform state creates physical-to-DRAM alias. | `PA_A != PA_B` but writes through one are observed through the other after cache-neutral independent reads. | Prove distinct PTE/PAs; CPU and DMA controls; cache maintenance; reboot/state restoration; unchanged-state negative control. | `BLOCKED BY WRITE GATE`; no candidate register. |
| 008 | A normal-RAM alias reaches a protected boundary. | Only after 007, a minimal non-secret marker/boundary test differs between normal and alias path. | No dump, exact ordering proof, secondary enforcement control. | `NOT ELIGIBLE`. |
